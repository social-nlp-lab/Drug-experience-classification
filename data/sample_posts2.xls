9g59w3	"Attempt at withdrawing from codeine. So last friday I'd gone a bit mad with the codeine, drinking and taking like 300mg.i decided to stop and went cold turkey on the Saturday, Sunday at 6am I was shivering coughing up blood etc. It scared me a bit. Went to the Dr's at 8 am on the Sunday, they checked me over and other than a low oxygen count he said I was fine and gave me some antibiotics, which I've saved for something useful(I get tonsillitis frequently). So this week I took the week off work to try and taper, costing a fortune in pay and feeling pretty bad about my poor attempy at stopping.

Today I decided to have a second attempt at it and I'm now getting that same chesty cough I had last week, I've got enough codeine to do a 50 % reduction over the week, back to work Monday no matter what. I feel stupid, I thought I was in control  and didn't do the smart thing and try a longer taper.

I know it's only codiene but I've not experienced this before, having done other drugs in my life, non have left me physically dependent like this, its quite amazing. 

I hope the chest thing is withdrawal and not something more serious, seems to be a lot of Tb coming to the UK from Asia etc. 


Good luck to all those quitting. 

Cheers. "													disclose	disclose

I want to use it for studying, I«ve been suffering from depression and anxiety for a decade now but in my country there«s NO way to get your hands on stims because of VERY restrictive laws.

So 43 mins in I«ve felt a sudden change, it was so weird, I felt like a wave of energy pass by me and now I«m super focused and feel amazing. I«ve tried Modafinil before but that was jackshit compared to this, holy shit. I«ll proceed to work out and study now, let«s see if that works!"													not applicable	not applicable
lk8360	Coke cut with polyethylene?? 														
rj5g0x	I think IÕm getting addicted. I donÕt know how to stop. IÕve been doing coke on and off for a few years now. Last year during the pandemic I started doing it every weekend. I would have bbqÕs with my roommates and close friends and we do lines. A good friend of mine and I would do it on Friday nights this went on for a while. I hit a low point with it this past summer and stopped for a few weeks but started up again. More recently I havenÕt been working my usual job but IÕve been working on something else that IÕm trying to get done by Christmas. IÕve been using blow kind of as a tool to finish. I did it for 4 days last week and I was going to stop myself and not do it until New Years with friends but I found myself having cravings and wanting to work on this project Im trying to finish so IÕve been doing lines all night. I used to hate blow. So much. And then friends of mine got me into it. IÕm doing more now even tho I know I should stop. IÕm starting to get concerned for myself. When I drink I want it. My friends do it too but not as much as me I guess. They also know theyÕve enabled me in the past. Im not sure how to really take the breaks I know I need. Any one have advise on self control?

7pfysq	"Worry of speed overdose permanent damage Hi guys, 

I'm a young 23 yo male. 10 days ago I was so stupid to snort 2 grams of speed (I didn't really know what it was then), I was initially feeling high and all, and after that I took rest, eating and sleeping normally. But it's been 10 days and i feel inability to concentrate (i am still able to work on my 9-5 job normally), involuntarily face muscle twitching and hearing white noise.

I would like to ask if that dosage might result in permanent brain damage, or how long these symptoms would last? I am not happy since my study and work performance can't be 100% like this."
