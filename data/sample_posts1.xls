"bkaehv","Quick question about opiates & benzos?! So I took 10mg Valium last night and then 10mg the night before that. I’m about to take a perc 10 today. I know Valium’s half life is insane so would I be in any danger taking the perc today? I know you really aren’t suppose to mix benzos & opoids. I’m not taking any benzos today... but I assume the Valium is still running it’s course in my system"

"88fv5g","Is there a way to get higher off subutex? I’ve been getting them for a while now. I had a few days where I didn’t take any, and when I got more, I only took a little bit and got super high. It was awesome. But now I don’t feel anything at all when I take them. No matter how many I take. I feel like my best option is to try to not take any and let my tolerance go down, but I was wondering if there was anything else? I tried railing them, too, but I still don’t feel anything. "
"96exlt","Worried about tolerance/surgery I’m having surgery the first week of September. Peroneus brevis tendon repair w/calcaneal osteotomy. I’m a little anxious about the pain level after the nerve block wears off and just the pain level in general. I had micro fracture surgery on my big toe a couple years ago and was given Percocet 10s and tramadol ( I couldn’t stand the side effects of tramadol). The pain of a surgery just in my toe was literally 10/10, sobbing, worst thing I’ve ever felt when the block wore off despite starting the meds before it wore off. In the surgery packet I was given, it says they prescribe Norco for the pain. Doesn’t say what strength. I’ve been taking Tylenol 3s and Norco 5mg I got my parents to give me for the pain in the meantime (both have had recentish surgery and are upper middle aged). I’m visiting them tomorrow and plan to try and re up my supply of whatever they have and don’t want. They don’t know the extent of my pill usage. Anyways, I am concerned because while the Norco definitely feels nice if I take 3-4 with some Benadryl, I’m not sure if it will even touch the pain of what is essentially having part of my heel bone sawed off and reattached with pins.  If Percocet 10s couldn’t help me before with no tolerance I definitely feel like I’m in for a shitty ride. And I don’t know how to ask about it without sounding drug seeking. I refuse to take tramadol. I still have the pills from my other sugery (not sure why since I will never take them and I’m on an SSRI and seratomin syndrome freaks me out a bit). I know I should stop taking any opiates until my surgery to lower my tolerance but that’s easier said than done. Any advice? Sorry for the wall of text, on mobile. "
"g5rc81","Acetaminophen Would it be the end of the world if I ended up taking over the 4000mg a day that they say is the max within 24 hours? It’d end up being around 4500mg. I normally don’t take any acetaminophen but all I could find was tabs"

"hp01xs","Advice on using Ativan hello everyone. not sure if this is the right place but i just wanted to hear some people’s personal experiences with ativan. the last couple days i have had nonstop dizzy/anxiety spells like i’ve never experience before, like barely able to breathe, constant crying, just able to function enough to get up for the bathroom. i’m not prescribed it but someone i know who is prescribed it for panic attacks suggested giving me a super tiny dose, like around .25 mg in the liquid form and i read about it saw that it it’s used for anxiety and stuff so i took it. idk if this is relevant but the only meds i’m on now is trazodone 150 mg and a birth control implant in my arm and i’m about 130 lbs female. i could definitely tell a tiny difference but i was just nervous to take any higher because i know it’s a benzo and that kinda scares me cause i’ve heard the horror stories. so i just wanna know your opinions on it? is it safe for me to take .25-5mg during a panic attack? i am definitely not going to be using it recreationally but this is the first thing i’ve ever tried that i could tell that it was helping my anxiety in such a quick time. and i also was wondering how it reacts with marijuana? i haven’t smoked since i took the ativan but i generally smoke every day so is there anything i should be worried about? and also how do i bring up to my doctor that i might want a prescription? 

thanks in advance, sorry if i sound stupid i’m just trying to feel better while being as safe as possible"

"dpoin7","Fent vs Oxy These fetti blues be something else. I take a quarter of a fent 30 and I’m right. Sometimes I pop two but that usually makes for a very warm and sleepy time. Is my tolerance through the roof at this point? I haven’t taken a perc 10 in so long I don’t even know how I compare to my baseline. I can’t go 6 hours without it without being sick af. If I don’t use before bed I’ll wake up in the middle of the night sweating and wanting more. Anyone else go through this? Been really thinking about getting on the subs lately. Most ppl that fucked with these same ones can’t handle more than a quarter piece and usually end up sick af and/or  “overdosing”. I don’t have that problem though. I stomach it just fine. Keeps me up and aware and able to get all my shit done. A half of one and a blunt after work complimented with back rubs from my loving wife and I’m in heaven for a short while."
